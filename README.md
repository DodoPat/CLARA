# CLARA
An appropriate water disinfection technology for humanitarian contexts.

The CLARA system aims at automatic water disinfection using sodium hypochlorite obtained by WATAÂ® devices. The system is controlled by and Arduino-based hardware able to insert the right amount of disinfectant solution depending on the volume of water in the tank. The goal is to keep a concentration of Free Residual Chlorine of at least 0.5 ppm at the point of delivery, able to kill 99,9% of pathogens and avoid recontamination of water during transport and storage.
CLARA is a plug&play system that combines ease of installation and adaptability. It can be easily modified both in the software and in the hardware to fulfil the needs of every situation and environment. It can operate with any kind of tank in a batch or continuous process.  It can work connected with electricity or with only a small solar panel and a battery. CLARA is also integrated with bluetooth and GSM communication modules that make it able to be controlled remotely and receive water data. The system can easily be managed and maintained by a trained person without large technical skills that will also take care of replacing spare parts.
